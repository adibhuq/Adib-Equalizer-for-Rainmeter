# Adib-Visualizer-for-Rainmeter
Because safe working desktop visualizer software is rare for Rainmeter. Made using documentation.
Unpack zip file in skins folder of rainmeter and feel free to replace image with another narrow image of your choice.
No image means you get 10 tiny green bars as visualizer.
